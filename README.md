These Perl CGI scripts facilitate interactive web-based tests for CS1 or CS2
programming courses.

.htaccess: A sample file that enables web authentication for MCSurvey.cgi.

MCSurvey.cgi: Takes responses from a web form and saves them on the web server.
This could be used for an online survey (for a user study) or for a web-based
multiple choice test. This script is a Perl version of the CGI script in the
SAGE_MC project, and is compatible with all the html and Java resources in that
project.

MCSurveySample.html: A sample web form to demonstrate the use of MCSurvey.cgi.

population.cgi: Responds with country information when queried. This was used
to provide web-based input for CS programming tests.
